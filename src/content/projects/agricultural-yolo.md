role: Computer Vision Developer (YOLO / Object Detection)
description:
  - Developed an object detection system using YOLO to detect and count chili peppers from agricultural images. I collected and prepared the dataset from scratch, including image selection and manual annotation. I then trained and tested the model, evaluated detection results, and refined the dataset to improve accuracy. The project outputs bounding boxes and confidence scores, and reflects practical experience in image processing, dataset preparation, and basic model training for real-world agricultural use cases.
